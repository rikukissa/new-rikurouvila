# Project template for [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/)

## What it does
* [Jade](jade-lang.com) files to HTML
* [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus) files to CSS
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) files to Javascript through [browserify](http://browserify.org/)
    * You are able to use 'require' in your client-side code
* Serves your static files to localhost:9001
* Reloads your browser with LiveReload when files change

## Getting things up and running

    git clone git@github.com:leonidas/gulp-project-template.git
    npm install
    npm start
    open http://localhost:9001 in your browser

## Commands
* npm install
    * Installs server-side dependencies from NPM and client-side dependencies from Bower
* npm start
    * Compiles your files, starts watching files for changes, serves static files to port 9001
* npm run build
    * Builds & minifies everything

## Adding 3rd party libraries
    bower install jquery --save

Now to use jQuery in your frontend code, you'll need to add jQuery to **gulp-browserify** [config](https://github.com/deepak1556/gulp-browserify#browserify-shim). Your [compiler config](https://github.com/leonidas/gulp-project-template/blob/master/gulpfile.coffee#L17-L19) should be something like this:

    compileCoffee = (debug = false) ->
      config =
        debug: debug
        transform: ['coffeeify']
        shim:
          jquery:
            path: './vendor/jquery/jquery.js'
            exports: '$'

Now your should be able to require jQuery in your coffee files

    $Â = require 'jquery'


## Development guidelines
* **public** - directory should be dedicated only to compiled/copied files from **src** - directory.
  It should be possible to delete directory completely and after **npm start** or **npm run build** everything should be as they were before the deletation.

## Enable LiveReload
Install [LiveReload for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en)
